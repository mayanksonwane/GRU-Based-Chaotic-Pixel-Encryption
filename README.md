# GRU-Based-Chaotic-Pixel-Encryption
Secure ITS traffic image data with GRU-based chaotic pixel encryption. This project implements a three-phase encryption algorithm combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Sine-Cosine chaotic maps. Protect sensitive traffic information from theft and misuse during transmission with advanced encryption technology.
